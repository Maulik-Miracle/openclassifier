# openclassifier
Artificial Neural Network over Core Java, Data Structures. The basic idea is to use this as a platform to have high performance &amp; Low Latency implementation for Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics &amp; Natural Language Processing.

What does this project do?
    This project demonstrates working Artificial Neural Network, which can be used for Analytics, Machine Learning & Orthogonal Relationship lookup across the stored Neurals.
    
Why is this project useful?
    This project is an attempt to provide a compute platform within core java, to perform Artificial Intelligent functions.
    
How do I get started?
    You can perform a pull request. There are Junit Test Cases which you can invoke and start modifying the code as per your requirement, or extend the functionality by coding over it. You can also contribute your code piece here. I will soon document the commit request process.
    
Where can I get more help, if I need it?
    You can send an email to me maulik@miracleatwork.com to connect with me. I will soon come up with some option to have a better communication channel.
    
How to Contribute?
    I am very much thankful for your willingness of contributing to the opensource. I have to plan this activity and i will update soon on this. Meanwhile you can share an idea over my email maulik@miracleatwork.com, on how to do this.
    
History:
    Miracle Software Solutions is an Enterprise Software Solutions company. One of its Product is  "Classifier", which  provides Artificial Neural Network. Its our endeavour to contribute to the opensource. We noticed that there are not many options to define an Artificial Neural Network over pure Java, hence we started this opensource project and we are very happy and excited to collborate with the community and also "To Give Back" to Opensource Community.
